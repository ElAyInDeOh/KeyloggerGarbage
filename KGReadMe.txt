KeyloggerGarbage

Overview:

KeyloggerGarbageis a defensive tool designed to help protect against keylogger surveillance by injecting "garbage" keystrokes into the keyboard input stream. This makes it more difficult for basic keyloggers to accurately record what you're actually typing.
How It Works
The application uses several techniques to confuse potential keyloggers:

Garbage Keystroke Injection: Randomly injects fake keystrokes that appear in keyboard hooks but don't affect your applications
Shadow Typing: Inputs characters similar to what you actually typed
Special Key Injection: Periodically injects special keys (arrows, function keys) to confuse pattern analysis
Variable Timing: Implements randomized delays between injections to avoid predictable patterns

Getting Started
System Requirements

Windows 7/8/10/11
.NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher
Administrator privileges (required for low-level keyboard hooks)

Installation

Download the latest release from the releases page
Extract all files to a location of your choice
Run KeyloggerGarbage.exe (right-click and "Run as Administrator" recommended)

Usage

Launch the application
Check "Enable Protection" to activate defense mechanisms
Adjust the protection slider to control the frequency of garbage keystrokes:

Lower values (left): Less frequent garbage injection, better performance
Higher values (right): More frequent garbage injection, stronger protection but potentially more noticeable


The "Live Input" box shows both your real keystrokes and injected garbage (for demonstration purposes)
The "Activity Log" displays technical details about protection activities
Click "Export Log" to save the activity log for analysis

Protection Effectiveness
Effective Against:

Basic hook-based keyloggers that operate at the Windows message level
Simple hardware keyloggers that don't perform timing analysis
Less sophisticated malware without multiple capture methods

Limited Protection Against:

Advanced keyloggers with timing analysis capabilities
Keyloggers that operate at driver level or below
Malware using multiple capture techniques

Not Effective Against:

Screen capture malware
Form grabbers that capture data after input processing
Memory-reading malware that extracts text from application memory
Specialized keyloggers designed to detect and filter obfuscation
Keyloggers with advanced heuristics or AI-based pattern recognition

Important Limitations and Warnings
⚠️ THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE SECURITY SOLUTION

This tool provides a layer of obfuscation but does not replace proper security practices
The application cannot detect if a keylogger is present on your system
No protection is offered against screen capture, clipboard monitoring, or memory inspection
Some applications may behave unexpectedly with protection enabled (especially games or applications using special keyboard handling)
Performance impact increases with higher protection levels
If you suspect your system is compromised, this tool alone is insufficient - seek professional help

Best Practices When Using KeyloggerGarbage

Use in conjunction with reputable antivirus/anti-malware software
Enable protection only when inputting sensitive information
For highly sensitive data (banking credentials, etc.), consider additional security measures:

Use an on-screen keyboard for the most sensitive parts
Consider a secure boot environment for critical transactions
Use two-factor authentication whenever possible


Regularly update the application to get the latest obfuscation techniques

Advanced Settings
Registry Settings
The following registry keys can be modified to customize protection (requires restart):

HKCU\Software\KeyloggerDefender\StartWithWindows: Set to 1 to start automatically with Windows
HKCU\Software\KeyloggerDefender\ProtectionLevel: Default protection level (1-10)

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Problem: Application won't start or crashes immediately
Solution: Ensure you're running as Administrator, verify .NET Framework installation
Problem: Real keystrokes not registering in applications
Solution: Decrease protection level, restart application, or check for conflicts with other keyboard tools
Problem: System performance degradation
Solution: Lower the protection level or disable protection when not needed
